# C++ Game Collection

This repository contains three different console-based games implemented in C++: a simple number guessing game, a rock-paper-scissors game, and a tic-tac-toe game.

## Number Guessing Game

### Overview

In the number guessing game, the player has to guess a random number chosen by the computer within a limited number of attempts.

### Features

- Three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- The player has a limited number of attempts based on the selected difficulty level.
- The game provides feedback to the player based on their guesses.

### Usage

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++): g++ number_guessing_game.cpp -o number_guessing_game
2. Run the compiled executable: ./number_guessing_game
3. Select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) and follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

### Overview

The rock-paper-scissors game allows the player to compete against the computer in a series of rounds, selecting rock, paper, or scissors as their choice.

### Features

- Three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- The computer's choice is determined randomly based on the selected difficulty level.
- The game tracks the score and declares a winner after the specified number of rounds.

### Usage

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++): g++ filename.cpp
2. Run the compiled executable: ./a.exe
3. Select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) and follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

### Overview

The tic-tac-toe game allows two players to compete against each other in the classic tic-tac-toe board game.

### Features

- Players take turns entering row and column numbers to place their symbols ('x' or 'o') on the game board.
- The game checks for a winner after each move and ends when one player wins or when there is a draw.

### Usage

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++): g++ filename.cpp
2. Run the compiled executable: ./a.exe
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Enter row and column numbers to place your symbol ('x' or 'o') on the game board.
